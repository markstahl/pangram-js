### Introduction

A pangram is a sentence that uses every letter of the alphabet.

> The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

> The quick onyx goblin jumps over the lazy dwarf.

> Grumpy wizards make toxic brew for the evil queen and jack.


## Getting Started

```no-highlight
$ cd ~/challenges
$ et get pangram-js
$ cd pangram-js
```

Open the project folder in your code editor. In your `main.js` file, you'll see an array of test sentences, each of which has a `sentence` attribute (containing the text) and a `pangram` attribute (which is `true` or `false` based on whether the sentence is a pangram).

### Instructions

For each sentence in the array, we want to be able to call an `isPangram` function on it, which will return `true` if a given sentence is a pangram, and returns `false`, otherwise.

We have provided most of the starter code in your `main.js` file. Please complete the `isPangram` function so it accomplishes our goals above!
